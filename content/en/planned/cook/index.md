## 🍳 Cooking Journey Plan 🧑‍🍳

### 1. Learning the Basics (6 months)  
- Start with the **basics**! I’ll practice simple dishes like fried eggs 🍳🥬 and learn how to chop and prepare ingredients properly.  
- I'll watch **YouTube** or take **cooking classes** to start developing my own cooking style! 😊

### 2. Exploring World Cuisine (1 year)  
- I want to learn signature dishes from different countries! 🌍  
- From **Italian pasta** to **Japanese sushi**, and **French desserts**, I’ll try various recipes and build up my cooking skills. 🍝🍣🍰  
- Whenever I create a new dish, I'll invite friends over for a **tasting party**! 🎉

### 3. Creating My Own Dishes (Ongoing Activity)  
- Once I’ve mastered the basics, I’ll start creating **my own recipes**. 🍲  
- I’ll mix ingredients freely, make dishes that I want to eat, experiment, and figure out ways to improve.  
- I’ll keep a cooking journal to track which ingredients go well together and how to balance flavors. ✍️📖

### 4. Cooking Time with Friends (Ongoing Activity)  
- Cooking alone can be fun, but it’s even better with **friends**!  
- I plan to host a **Cooking Day** every week, inviting friends to cook together and taste each other's dishes. 🍕👯‍♂️  
- Sometimes we’ll have cooking competitions to crown a winner and enjoy some friendly competition! 🏆🎊

### 5. Starting a Cooking Blog or Social Media (Last 6 Months)  
- I want to **document** my creations, so I’ll start a cooking blog or share my recipes and photos on **Instagram**! 📸🍴  
- I’ll connect with others, receive feedback, and gain even more cooking ideas. 💬💡  
- My dream is to become a chef who shares my unique recipes with the world! ✨👩‍🍳

Cooking is joy! 🍽️ As I follow this plan, I’ll deepen my love for cooking, and one day, I’ll be a **great chef** known for my amazing flavors. 😎🔥
