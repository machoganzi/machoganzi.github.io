## Key Learning Plan

**1. Learning the Basics (6 months)**  
   - I plan to take online courses on platforms like Coursera or Udemy on web service design and development.  
   - I will read books like *"Designing Data-Intensive Applications"* and *"Web Design with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"*.

**2. Improving Programming Skills (Ongoing Learning)**  
   - I will regularly practice coding with languages like JavaScript, Python, and SQL.  
   - I will work on weekly coding challenges through sites like LeetCode and Codewars to enhance my problem-solving skills.

**3. Project Work (1 year)**  
   - I plan to start personal projects, such as building a simple e-commerce site or a blog platform.  
   - I will also contribute to open-source projects related to web development.

**4. Networking and Community Involvement (Ongoing Activity)**  
   - I will attend web development meetups and participate in online communities like Reddit and Stack Overflow.  
   - I also plan to attend web development conferences or webinars to stay updated on the latest trends.

**5. Research and Writing (Last 6 months)**  
   - I will choose an interesting topic, such as scalable web service architecture, for in-depth research.  
   - I will document my findings in a blog post or a small report.
