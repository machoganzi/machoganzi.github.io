## Database Administrator Study Plan

**1. Learn Basic Concepts (6 months)**  
- I plan to take online courses on platforms like Coursera or Udemy to learn about database management systems (DBMS) and database concepts.  
- I will also read books like *"Database System Concepts"* or *"Designing Data-Intensive Applications"* to solidify the foundational theory.

**2. Improve Programming Skills (Ongoing Study)**  
- I will practice programming languages such as SQL, Python, and JavaScript regularly.  
- Solving coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode or Codewars will help improve my problem-solving abilities.

**3. Execute Projects (1 year)**  
- I plan to start building simple database-driven applications, such as a personal shopping mall or blog platform.  
- I will also contribute to open-source projects on GitHub to gain practical experience.

**4. Community Engagement & Networking (Ongoing Activity)**  
- I will actively participate in online communities related to databases (e.g., Reddit, Stack Overflow), expanding my knowledge through questions and discussions.  
- Additionally, I plan to attend database conferences or webinars to learn about the latest technology trends.

**5. Research & Writing (Last 6 Months)**  
- I will choose an interesting topic related to database management for in-depth research. For example, a topic like scalable database architecture would be ideal.  
- I plan to summarize my findings in a blog post or write a small report to share and organize my knowledge.

Through this plan, I aim to build the skills and experience needed to become a database administrator! Iâ€™m committed to achieving my goal through consistent effort.
