Zwagger is a group of students who love hip-hop culture and music. We explore and develop various elements of hip-hop, including rapping, beat-making, and breakdancing.

## Main Activities
- Weekly hip-hop sessions
- Hosting an annual hip-hop festival
- Collaborations with local hip-hop artists

We welcome all students interested in hip-hop. No experience is necessary. Our goal is to learn and grow together!
