Learning the Basics (6 months) Start with the basics! I’ll practice simple dishes like fried eggs 🍳🥬 and learn how to chop and prepare ingredients properly. I’ll watch YouTube or take cooking classes to start developing my own cooking style! 😊 2. Exploring World Cuisine (1 year) I want to learn signature dishes from different countries! 🌍 From Italian pasta to Japanese sushi, and French desserts, I’ll try various recipes and build up my cooking skills. 🍝🍣🍰 Whenever I create a new dish, I’ll invite friends over for a tasting party! 🎉 3. Creating My Own Dishes (Ongoing Activity) Once I’ve mastered the basics, I’ll start creating my own recipes. 🍲 I’ll mix ingredients freely, make dishes that I want to eat, experiment, and figure out ways to improve. I’ll keep a cooking journal to track which ingredients go well together and how to balance flavors. ✍️📖 4. Cooking Time with Friends (Ongoing Activity) Cooking alone can be fun, but it’s even better with friends! I plan to host a Cooking Day every week, inviting friends to cook together and taste each other’s dishes. 🍕👯‍♂️ Sometimes we’ll have cooking competitions to crown a winner and enjoy some friendly competition! 🏆🎊 5. Starting a Cooking Blog or Social Media (Last 6 Months) I want to document my creations, so I’ll start a cooking blog or share my recipes and photos on Instagram! 📸🍴 I’ll connect with others, receive feedback, and gain even more cooking ideas. 💬💡 My dream is to become a chef who shares my unique recipes with the world! ✨👩‍🍳 Cooking is joy! 🍽️ As I follow this plan, I’ll deepen my love for cooking, and one day, I’ll be a great chef known for my amazing flavors. 😎🔥\n","date":1728086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1728086400,"objectID":"bd18e14fa067f89dbe62ee4f4fb42207","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/planned/cook/","publishdate":"2024-10-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/planned/cook/","section":"planned","summary":"Finding the dish I cook best","tags":["Eggs","Cook","Chef"],"title":"My Own Cooking Journey! 🍕","type":"planned"},{"authors":["Kim Sun Gang"],"categories":null,"content":"Key Learning Plan 1.
